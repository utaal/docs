.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: indexStats

   The command can be slow, particularly on large indexes.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { indexStats: "collection_name",
        index: "index_name" }

   This command provides detailed and aggregate information and statistics for the underlying
   btree for the index ``index_name`` in the collection ``collection_name``.
   Stats are aggregated for the entire tree, per-depth and, if requested through the ``expandNodes``
   option, per-subtree.

   You can specify ``expandNodes: [0, 3]`` to expand the root (node 0 at depth 0) and the 4th child
   of root (node 3 at depth 1). The first element of the array should always be 0 otherwise no
   node will be expanded (there's only root ad depth 0). This will provide basic information about
   the expanded nodes and statistics for the subtrees rooted at the nodes themselves.

   The typical output has the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         { name: <index name>,
           version: <index version (0 or 1),
           isIdKey: <true if this is the default _id index>,
           keyPattern: <bson object describing the key pattern>,
           storageNs: <namespace of the index's underlying storage>,
           bucketBodyBytes: <bytes available for keynodes and bson objects in the bucket's body>,
           depth: <index depth (root excluded)>
           overall: { (statistics for the entire tree)
               numBuckets: <number of buckets (samples)>
               keyCount: { (stats about the number of keys in a bucket)
                   count: <number of samples>,
                   mean: <mean>
        (optional) stddev: <standard deviation>
        (optional) min: <minimum value (number of keys for the bucket that has the least)>
        (optional) max: <maximum value (number of keys for the bucket that has the most)>
        (optional) quantiles: {
                       0.01: <1st percentile>, 0.02: ..., 0.09: ..., 0.25: <1st quartile>,
                       0.5: <median>, 0.75: <3rd quartile>, 0.91: ..., 0.98: ..., 0.99: ...
                   }
        (optional fields are only present if there are enough samples to compute sensible
         estimates)
               }
               usedKeyCount: <stats about the number of used keys in a bucket>
                   (same structure as keyCount)
               bsonRatio: <stats about how much of the bucket body is occupied by bson objects>
                   (same structure as keyCount)
               keyNodeRatio: <stats about how much of the bucket body is occupied by KeyNodes>
                   (same structure as keyCount)
               fillRatio: <stats about how full is the bucket body (bson objects + KeyNodes)>
                   (same structure as keyCount)
           },
           perLevel: [ (statistics aggregated per depth)
               (one element with the same structure as 'overall' for each btree level,
                the first refers to the root)
           ]
         }

   If 'expandNodes: [array]' was specified in the parameters, an additional field named
   'expandedNodes' is included in the output. It contains two nested arrays, such that the
   n-th element of the outer array contains stats for nodes at depth n (root is included) and
   the i-th element (0-based) of the inner array at depth n contains stats for the subtree
   rooted at the i-th child of the expanend node at depth (n - 1).
   Each element of the inner array has the same structure as 'overall' in the description above:
   it includes the aggregate stats for all the nodes in the subtree excluding the current
   bucket.
   It also contains an additional field 'nodeInfo' representing information for the current
   node:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         { childNum: <i so that this is the (i + 1)-th child of the parent node>
           keyCount: <number of keys in this bucket>
           usedKeyCount: <number of non-empty KeyNodes>
           diskLoc: { (bson representation of the disk location for this bucket)
               file: <num>
               offset: <bytes>
           }
           depth: <depth of this bucket, root is at depth 0>
           fillRatio: <a value between 0 and 1 representing how full this bucket is>
           firstKey: <bson object containing the value for the first key>
           lastKey: <bson object containing the value for the last key>
         }

   The :program:`mongo` shell also provides wrappers:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.indexStats({index: "index_name"});
      db.collection.getIndexStats({index: "index_name"});

      ``db.collection.indexStats({index: "index_name"})`` is equivalent to running the command
      with {indexStats: "collection", index: "index_name"}.

      ``db.collection.getIndexStats`` takes the same parameters as ``indexStats`` and provides
      a human-readable summary of the output in the shell.

   .. warning:: This command is resource intensive and may have an
      impact on the performance of your MongoDB instance. It also requires
      the entire collection or extent to be loaded in RAM and it may
      end up evicting some of the pages from other collections or extents.
